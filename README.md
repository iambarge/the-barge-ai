# :ship: THE BARGE
**THE BARGE** is a portfolio repository for all the AI related projects I have done for academic, professional, self-learning and hobby purposes.

As an Automation Engineer and AI enthusiast, during my career I had the opportunity to practice different sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence. Therefore, **THE BARGE** is arranged in different *decks*: 
- [**Machine Learning Projects**](#machine-learning-projects)
- [**Computer Vision Projects**](#computer-vision-projects)
- [**Autonomous Systems Projects**](#autonomous-systems-projects)

If you have any question on the featured projects or if you are interested in activating a collaboration do not hesitate to write me at bargellesi.n@gmail.com or on [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iambarge/iambarge/main/src/linkedin_icon.png" width="16" height="16">](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolo-bargellesi/).

Coin identification and recognition can significantly enhance the functions of vending machines, pay phone systems and coin counting machines. The primary purpose of this project is to develop a detector capable of finding and classifying Euro coins in images purely relying on CV frameworks.

Multi-Camera surveillance systems are being increasingly used to enhance safety and security and the possibility to mount cameras on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) extends their capabilities to a whole new level. The aim of this project is to find a possible solution to the Interactive Surveillance problem using multiple UAV mounted cameras.
